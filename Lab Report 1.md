   The current working directory is "/home".

   **ls** means “List”. It used to list the files and folders the given path. If there's no argument in this command, it shows the list for current directory. In my computer, it shows the folder "lecture1" and a file "URIMain.class".

   **No Error**

   **Error:** it doesn't show the list of files and folders since file is the smallest unit and there is no folder and file inside another file.


A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
What the working directory was when the command was run
A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it’s an error, explain why it’s an error.

## Command "cat"
1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
   
   <img width="234" alt="cat1" src="https://github.com/Kriiiiss/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/147010005/bf455a4d-6dae-4cf0-a03e-b7b3045e8d0d">

   The current working directory is "/home".

   **cat** means “Concatenate”. It used to print the contents of one or more files given by the paths. If there's no argument in this command, it doesn't have any output and it waits for an input from keyboard. I don't think it is an error because it requires additional instructions to complete.

   **No Error**

2. Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.

   <img width="298" alt="cat2" src="https://github.com/Kriiiiss/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/147010005/eea1a630-9fd2-4656-9101-15aa09ad0d9a">

   The current working directory is "/home".

   **cat** is used to print the contents of one or more files given by the paths. When we use command with a path to a directory "cat lecture1", it will output that lecture1 is a Directory so that it cannot print any content.

   **Error:** it is not a file and cat is only for showing the content of the file, so it cannot be used for a directory.

   The current working directory is "/home".

   **cat** means “Concatenate”. It used to print the contents of one or more files given by the paths. When I use the command with a path to a file "cat lecture1/messages/en-us.txt", it will print the content inside the file "en-us.txt". If I use two argument with 2 path to a file "cat lecture1/messages/en-us.txt lecture1/messages/es-mx.txt", it will print two file sequently.

   **No Error**
