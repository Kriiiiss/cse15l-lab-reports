# Lab Report 3 - Bugs and Commands

## Part 1 - Bugs

```
#Original Code

public class ArrayExamples {

  // Changes the input array to be in reversed order
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
}

```

**1. A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code**

```

import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.*;

public class ArrayTests {
    @Test 
	public void testReverseInPlace1() {
    int[] input1 = {1,2,3};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3,2,1}, input1);
	}
}

```

**2. An input that doesn’t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code**

```

import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.*;

public class ArrayTests {
	@Test 
	public void testReverseInPlace2() {
    int[] input1 = { 3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
	}
}

```

**3. The symptom, as the output of running the tests**

**4. The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it**

Before

```


// Changes the input array to be in reversed order
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
  for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
    arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
  }
}


```

After

```

static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length/2; i += 1) {
      int temp;
      temp = arr[i];
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
      arr[arr.length - i - 1] = temp;
    }
  }

```

The command-line options -i is used to search a string in a txt file in whatever uppercase and lowercase. The example above shows that when we search a string "apple", the output shows the uppercase and lowercase "apple" which can help us search more relative information.

```

The command-line options -i is used to search a string in a txt file in whatever uppercase and lowercase. The example above shows that when we search a string "HaPPy", the output shows the uppercase and lowercase "happy" that can help us avoid case errors.

Option 2 --- "-l"

```

The command-line options -l only shows the file which contain string "Pair" exactly. We can only see how many files contain this string and don't care about how many string in one file.

```

% grep  -l "help" technical/911report/*

technical/911report/chapter-8.txt
technical/911report/chapter-9.txt
technical/911report/preface.txt

```

The command-line options -l only shows the file which contain string "help". This will help us find which chapter contains the word "help".

Option 3 --- "-r"

```

grep  -r "save" technical/911report/*

```

The command-line options -r shows the line in this file which can help us find how many lines contain "save" in this directory.

```

grep  -r "AppLe" technical/911report/*
(The output is empty)

```

The command-line options -r shows the line in this file which can help us find how many lines contain "AppLe" in this directory. However, option -r can only find the string exactly "AppLe"with same uppercase and lower case. We can find the specific terminology in a text file.

Option 4 --- "-n"

```

The command-line options -n shows the line number of each matched string "apple". It helps us find the line on which the string appears.

```

```

The command-line options -n shows the line number of each matched string "file". It helps us find the line on which the string appears.
