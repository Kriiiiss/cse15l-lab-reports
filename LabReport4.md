4. Log into ieng6

Keys pressed: `ssh <space> <command>c <command>d <enter>` 

I type `ssh` and copy and paste my account number "cs15lfa23sn@ieng6.ucsd.edu" from my note, and then press `<enter>`. I can successfully log into ieng6 since I have already set key for login the Server `ieng6`

5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)

Keys pressed: `git <space> clone <space> <command>c <command>d <enter>`

I type `git clone` and then copy and paste the link `git@github.com:Kriiiiss/lab7.git` from my github website in lab7 repository. I can successfully clone this repository from my Github since I have created key in Server `ieng6` and link to the Github account for Authentication Keys.

6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

Keys pressed: `cd <space> l <tab> <enter>, bash <space> t <tab> <enter>`

I type `cd lab7` and press `<enter>` in terminal to change the directory to "lab7" since tab can autofill the folder name for "lab7" in current directory so I don't have to type the whole name. Then use `bash test.sh` to run the test since the bash script can run entire java file and type `t` and `<tab>` can autofill the file name "test.sh".


   
7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test



   
5. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
